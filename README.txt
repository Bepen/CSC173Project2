Project 2- Grammars and Parsing
Collaborators: Sailesh Kaveti (skaveti), Been Neupane (bneupane)

In order to run the project, just navigate to the project folder and type make to enter the project. For the table driven parser, the tree does not construct, and can only handle single digits. However, it does determine if an expression The stack is a modified version of the linked list class we were provided. For both parsers (table driven and recursive descent), do not put spaces in the string.

We used the linked list that was given to us in project 1 and modified it to a stack to suit our needs. We implemented the RDP similarly to what was done in the textbook. The language for the recursive descent parser was from the bottom of the project 2 prompt that ferguson provided us.
